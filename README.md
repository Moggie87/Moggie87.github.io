Hi there! 
My name is Dina, and I'm an aspiring JavaScript developer just starting my journey into the world of programming. 
Currently, I work as an Electrical Operations Leader in the energy industry, where I manage and oversee electrical systems and operations. 
My background in the technical field has helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, and now I'm channeling that expertise into learning coding and web development.

I'm passionate about continuously learning and growing in this field, and I’m excited to build new skills, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with others along the way. 
Always eager to take on new challenges and improve – let’s connect!
